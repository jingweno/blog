Jingwen Owen Ou is a Java samurai at daytime and a Ruby ninja at night. 
He had his MSc in Computer Science @ the beautiful [University of British Columbia][1] of Canada. 
During his master degree, Owen focused on building tools that ease the pain of software developers: 
he contributed to the Eclipse's [Mylyn][2] project, 
and as his thesis topic, he built an innovate tool that reduces information overload based on developers' knowledge of the codebase[^3].
